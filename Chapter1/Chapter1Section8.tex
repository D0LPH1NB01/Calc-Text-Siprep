\textbf{\underline{\large{1.8: Related Rates}}} \par

In this course, derivatives have primarily been interpreted as the slope of the tangent line. But, as with \href{https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rectilinear\%20motion}{\text{\textcolor{blue}{rectilinear motion}}}, there are other contexts for the derivative. One overarching concept is that the derivative is a \textbf{rate of change}. The tendency is to think of rates as distance per time unit, like miles per hour or meters per second, but even slope is a rate of change---it is just that the rise and run are both measured as distances. \par
