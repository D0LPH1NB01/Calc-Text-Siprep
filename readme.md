# AP Calc BC Textbook for Saint Ignatius College Preparatory

Hello!! My name is Wilson Chen, SI class of '25. This is a fun side project that I've been working on for the past couple of months, where I practice LaTeX by doing some edits on the current Calc BC textbook. 

Hope you find this useful :)

The full text lies within the file called "MainText.pdf"

The tex files and pdfs for each chapter are in their respective Chapter# folders

The preamble and other commands/settings are in Support/Settings.tex

Links to all videos are in https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Zf4oZXG6ctf94wPKOlyKIBbZ_X-aIGTz?usp=sharing.

Thanks for viewing :)
